  One day Bryant "Ballpark" Franks decided... "You know what... I'm not a hot
  dog, I'm a man damnit! Unfortunately he claimed that in-front of some terrible
  people who only heard "You know what..I'm not a hot dog" and then immediately
  tuned him out. From that day forward, he was known as Not Hot Dog

## Why Lake Jevin is nothing compared to Not Hot Dog.



So this is the longer section where you can type more shit about how this dude is not a hot dog. He's pretty cool in my book for taking it so well. Other lesser people **_like Lake Jevin_** are weaker and therefore get all butt hurt when you call them names like **Sissy man Jevin** and **Little Man Jevin**. Man that Lake Jevin guy is just awful, we should totally fire him.
